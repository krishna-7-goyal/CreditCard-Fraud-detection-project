## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Credit card fraud costs the global economy billions annually. This project aims to provide a **real-time fraud detection system** using machine learning, capable of detecting suspicious transactions and explaining its decisions using SHAP.

Key highlights:

- Built with **XGBoost** for accuracy and speed
- Tackles extreme **class imbalance** with SMOTE and strategic undersampling
- Deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions
- Powered by **SHAP** for transparent, interpretable AI


## ðŸš€ Features

- **Interactive Streamlit UI** for entering transaction details
- **Probability-based fraud classification**
- **SHAP visualizations** to explain model predictions
- **Time-based fraud analytics** (hour/day trends)
- Predicts based on:
  - Transaction Amount
  - Gender
  - City Population
  - Transaction Category
  - Latitude & Longitude
  - Time (Hour & Day)

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Classifier
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
  - Extracted temporal features (hour, day)
- **Balancing Strategy:**
  - Strategic undersampling (10x fraud ratio)
  - SMOTE for synthetic oversampling
- **Explainability:**
  - SHAP values aggregated per input feature group

### ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

| Class         | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Legitimate    | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |
| Fraudulent    | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |
| **Accuracy**  |           |        | **0.99** |
